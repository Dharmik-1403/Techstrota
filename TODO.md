# TODO: Make Background Video Scrollable with Page

- [ ] Edit `techstrota/src/app/page.js` to change the video positioning from fixed to absolute so it scrolls with the page content.
- [ ] Ensure the video remains as a background layer behind the content.
- [ ] Test scrolling behavior: video should move up when scrolling down, revealing footer and other content.
- [ ] Verify on different screen sizes and ensure smooth scrolling.
